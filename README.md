## Getting Full Power In Terminal

Becoming a super user is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ sudo su
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Be aware that with this command once it has been performed any commands after will be started as a power user.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, look at some fun things to do!
